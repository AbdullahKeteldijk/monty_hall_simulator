# Monty Hall Simulator

This notebook contains a Monty Hall Simulator that implements three different game strategies and calculates their succes ratios. 

We define three strategies:

* The first strategy is to randomly stick or switch doors
* The second strategy is to never switch doors
* The third strategy is to always switch doors


## The Monty Hall Problem explained

The Monty Hall Problem is a probability question that has caused a lot of debate and confusion. 
The problem originates from a game show called "Let's make a deal", hosted by Monty Hall. 
In order to win the constestants had to pick one of three doors. 
Behind one of the doors there was a a sports car and behind the other doors there was a goat. 
The contestant would then choose a door upon which Monty would open one of the remaining doors. 
The door that he opened would then show a goat. 
The contestant would then be asked is he or she wanted to switch doors or stick with the door they picked in the first place.

This problem is further explained in the video below.
